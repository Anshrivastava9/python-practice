The idea of Python originated in 1989 when its creator Guido van Rossum was confronted by the shortcomings of ABC language (namely extensibility). Rossum started work on developing a new language that integrated all good features of ABC language and new desired features, such as extensibility and exception handling. Python 1.0 was released in 1994; it borrowed the module system from Modula-3, had the capability to interact with Amoeba operating system, and included functional programming tools.
